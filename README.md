Few Key Points:

1. Fiscal Year: The fiscal year is a one-year period used for financial reporting and
budgeting, starting on April 1st and ending on March 31st of the following year in India.

2. Penetration Rate: This metric represents the percentage of total vehicles that are
electric within a specific region or category. It is calculated as:
  Penetration Rate = (Electric Vehicles Sold / Total Vehicles Sold) * 100
This indicates the adoption level of electric vehicles.

3. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): CAGR measures the mean annual growth
rate over a specified period longer than one year. It is calculated as:
CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value) ** 1/n] -1
